# Text-Based-Adventure

These files build up a text based adventure programme in Python. They are based on the resources at [Code Club](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/rpg). The idea is to allow pupils to see how the programme builds up and is refactored along the way. They will support pupils to learn Python by allowing them to modify and imporove on the code rather than working on it from scratch. Each file will include some tasks for the pupils to work on.
